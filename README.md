## Releases

A link to the latest release can be found within github: [releases](https://github.com/voliva/gw2-pvp-pips/releases)

## TODO

- Configure win/lose points (at the moment it assumes 4 points when lose, 11 points when winning)
- Configure win/lose rate (at the moment it assumes 50-50)
- Configure days that the user can't play (at the moment it assumes all days are playable)

## Technical details

Project built using [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), a framework that uses the OS' WebView to render a the front end (in React in this case, but it can be any other JS FE), which is orchestrated by a backend written in Rust.

Currently this project doesn't have any custom code on the BackEnd, all the logic is handled on the FE.

### Run in dev:

```
> npm i
> npm run tauri dev
```

While in dev you can open the webview devtools by using the platform's shortcut (e.g. F12 in windows)

### Compile binaries:

```
npm run tauri build
```

The resulting executable should be in `src-tauri/target/release`, and the installer in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle`

## License

The application uses some of the official assets from ArenaNet, namely the background of the window, and the icons available through their official API (pips, chests). These are trademarked by ArenaNet and NCSoft.
